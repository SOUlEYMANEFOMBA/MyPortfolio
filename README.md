# Portfolio Webseite

This portfolio website is inspired by the design of AlpayC's portfolio site "https://github.com/AlpayC/portfolio_site" and has been developed using React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It showcases my skills and projects as a full-stack developer. For the contact form, I implemented a backend built with Node.js and Express.
